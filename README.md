# Project Overview
Cancer is spreading badly day by day.Itis  such  kind  of disease  which ultimately  leads  the patients towards  death. Several  types  of  cancerhave been  found  in  the  human  body.Among  them,  the bone cancer is thedestructiveone.It is occurreddue tounregulated  growth  of the bone tissue.There arelot  of  chances  to  be  curedif  the  bone  cancer  is detected  early.Nowadays,many  datamining and image processing   techniques   are applied   for   the detection  purpose.  This study adoptedan  approach by using the  VGG-16 which is anarchitectureofthe Convolutional  Neural  Network(CNN). This  method has the capability of derivingvarious hidden layers to make its performance  better.The experimentwas conducted  by providing  medical  image  data.  MRI and CT images were collected due  to theselectionofthe dataset.The  confusion  matrix  hasbeenapplied for  the  purpose  of  evaluating  the  validation  result. The resultgives  94.73% of accuracy whiledetecting the bone cancer.
